### Solution

This code defines a function `compressedString` that compresses a given string `word` by counting consecutive occurrences of each character. The result is a string where each character is followed by the number of its consecutive occurrences, capped at 9.

### Let's break down the code step-by-step:

#### Function Signature and Initialization
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {string}
 */
var compressedString = function(word) {
    let comp = "";  // String to store the compressed result
    let cnt = 1;    // Counter for consecutive characters
    let n = word.length;  // Length of the input string
    let ch = word[0];     // Start with the first character
```

- The `compressedString` function takes one parameter, `word`, which is the string to be compressed.
- It initializes an empty string `comp` to build the compressed result.
- A variable `cnt` is set to `1` to count consecutive occurrences of the current character.
- `n` is initialized to the length of `word` for easy access.
- `ch` is set to the first character of `word` as the starting character for comparison.

#### Looping Through the String and Counting Consecutive Characters
```javascript
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (word[i] === ch && cnt < 9) {
            cnt++;
        } else {
            comp += cnt + ch;
            ch = word[i];
            cnt = 1;
        }
    }
```

- The `for` loop iterates through the string starting from the second character (`i = 1`) up to the last character.
  - If the current character (`word[i]`) is the same as the previous character (`ch`) and `cnt` is less than 9, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
  - If the character is different or `cnt` reaches 9, the function:
    - Adds the compressed version of the previous sequence (`cnt + ch`) to `comp`.
    - Updates `ch` to the current character (`word[i]`).
    - Resets `cnt` to 1 to start counting the new character sequence.

#### Adding the Last Character Sequence to the Result
```javascript
    comp += cnt + ch;
    return comp;
};
```

- After the loop, the function adds the last sequence (`cnt + ch`) to `comp` because the final sequence is not added inside the loop.
- Finally, the function returns `comp`, the compressed string.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
- **Input**: `word = "aaabbbbbccc"`
- **Process**:
  1. The first sequence of `a`s has 3 occurrences → `"3a"`.
  2. The next sequence of `b`s has 5 occurrences → `"5b"`.
  3. The final sequence of `c`s has 3 occurrences → `"3c"`.
  4. Combine these: `"3a5b3c"`.
- **Result**: The function returns `"3a5b3c"`.

#### Example 2
- **Input**: `word = "aabbcc"`
- **Process**:
  1. The first sequence of `a`s has 2 occurrences → `"2a"`.
  2. The next sequence of `b`s has 2 occurrences → `"2b"`.
  3. The final sequence of `c`s has 2 occurrences → `"2c"`.
  4. Combine these: `"2a2b2c"`.
- **Result**: The function returns `"2a2b2c"`.

### Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `word`, since we iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we construct a new compressed string in `comp`, which can be as long as the input string in the worst case.

This function efficiently compresses a string by counting consecutive characters and limiting each count to a maximum of 9, ensuring optimal performance and clarity.
